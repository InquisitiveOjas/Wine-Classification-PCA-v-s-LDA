My code follows the following sequential approach:-
(1)Importing the dataset
(2)Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
(3)Feature Scaling
(4)Applying PCA/LDA
(5)Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set
(6)Predicting the Test set results
(7)Making the Confusion Matrix
(8)Visualising the Training set results
(9)Visualising the Test set results
